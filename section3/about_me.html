    <h3>About Me:</h3>
    <p>
        My name is Bappan Nath. I graduated from GAUHATI UNIVERSITY a few month ago. Now, I am looking for my first full-time job. I have been working as a freelance web developer for the last two years and cooperated with several startups. I cannot say with 100% confidence where I see myself in five years or what my big career goal is. The world is changing rapidly, and I donâ€™t have enough professional experience to be certain about such things. However, I know that I can provide a fresh take and an extraordinary approach to every project. I am always open to challenges and constructive feedback. I am open-minded and learn new things quickly. I want to become a team player and dedicate all my skills and talents to develop high-quality and unique products.
